            <br><br><br><br><br><br><h2>SUSTAINABLE FOREST RESOURCE MANAGEMENT</h2>
            "The stewardship and use of forests and forest lands in a way, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality and their potential to fulfil, now and in the future, relevant ecological, economic and social functions, at local, national, and global levels, and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems."<br>
              
              <h3>1. Reduced Use of Timber wood and Fuelwood<br></h3>
              Fuelwood overuse can result in loosing forest and do more harm than good.<br>
            <ul type="disc" >
              <li>  Use biogas instead.</li>
              <li>  Plant trees for bio-fuel production.</li>
            </ul>
        
              Thus, using chemical fertilizers is like a double-edged sword.<br>
              
              <h3>2. Reforestation and Afforestation Should be Promoted<br></h3>
              One of the major causes of soil pollution is soil erosion, which is caused due to deforestation. It is natural that, with an ever-growing population, humankind needs more and more space to expand its civilization. Often, it is achieved at the cost of soil health. To prevent this from happening, reforestation of a deforested area should be promoted.<br>
              that is "TREE PLANTING"<br>
              Also, afforestation should be promoted and encouraged in the barren lands. The roots of the plants bind the soil particles together and even capture good microorganisms in the soil. It also ensures the maintenance of the underground water table.<br>
              
              <h3>3. Get the Locals Involved<br></h3>
              A problem like over exploitation of forest resources requires every individualâ€™s involvement. Things will work out better only when we realise our responsibility at the individual level. Awareness programs could be designed so that people understand better. If people are aware, they will help even subconsciously.<br>
