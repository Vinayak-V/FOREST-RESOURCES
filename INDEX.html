            <h2>FOREST RESOURCES</h2>
            <p>Forests play important role in maintaining ecological balance & contributes to economy also. Forests and forest resources contribute immensely to economy. These include: It provides valuable items like timber, paper, fuel wood, bamboo, cane, food, fibers and many essential oils.</p>

            <h2>Forest Resources exploitation and </h2>
            <p><br><p>Forests are a critical natural resource that provide a wide range of ecosystem services, including carbon sequestration, water regulation, soil conservation, and biodiversity conservation. However, forests are also subject to over-exploitation and degradation due to human activities such as logging, agriculture, and urbanization. Here are some of the ways forests are used and over-exploited:<br>

              <h3>1. Timber Extraction<br></h3>
              Forests are often logged for their valuable timber, which is used for building materials, paper production, and other purposes. Over-logging can lead to deforestation and habitat loss for wildlife.<br>
              
              <br><h3>2. Agricultural Expansion<br></h3>
              Forests are often cleared for agricultural purposes, such as the production of palm oil, soybeans, and other commodities. This can lead to soil degradation, erosion, and loss of biodiversity.              
              <h3>3. Urbanization<br></h3>
              Finally, a growing concern is how we dispose of our waste. While industrial waste is sure to cause contamination, there is another way in which we are adding to the pollution. Every person excretes a certain amount of personal waste in the form of urine and faeces.
              
              While much of it moves into the sewer system, a large amount is dumped directly into landfills in the form of diapers. Even the sewer system ends at the landfill, where the biological waste pollutes the soil and water. This is because our bodies are full of toxins and chemicals that are now seeping into the land and causing soil pollution.<br>
